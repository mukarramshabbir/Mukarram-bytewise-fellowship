I learned about widgets. The core of Flutter’s layout mechanism is widgets.In Flutter, almost everything is a widget—even layout models are widgets. The images, icons, and text that I see in a Flutter app are all widgets. But things that I don’t see are also widgets, such as the rows, columns, and grids that arrange, constrain, and align the visible widgets.
