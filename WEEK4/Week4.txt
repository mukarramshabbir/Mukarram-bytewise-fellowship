In Week 4 I learned about atateful and stateless widgets.
Stateless Widget: It is atatic. A stateless widget never changes Icon, IconButton, and Text are examples of stateless widgets. They remain static.
Stateful Widget: A stateful widget is dynamic: for example, it can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data. Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField are examples of stateful widgets
