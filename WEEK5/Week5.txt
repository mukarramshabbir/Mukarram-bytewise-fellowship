In Week 5 I learned about navigation and routing. I also added images and learned how to manage the assets. Each asset is identified by an explicit path (relative to the pubspec.yaml file) where the asset file is located. The order in which the assets are declared doesn’t matter. The actual directory name used (assets in first example or directory in the above example) doesn’t matter. During a build, Flutter places assets into a special archive called the asset bundle that apps read from at runtime.
